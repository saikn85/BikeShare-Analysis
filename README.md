# US Bike Share Analysis 2017
## Notes:
- Based the comments from the previous reviewer(s):
_"Unable to review:"_
    - _"Your project could not be reviewed. Please resubmit after you address the issue noted by the reviewer.
Submissions shouldn't have extensive requirements to run the file. This is meant to be a simple intro project to wrangling techniques. We should only require your single .py script along with the required csvs"._
    - _"It should not be necessary to use packages not covered in class or does not come default with Anaconda."_
- I've included the .csv files and combined all my modules into one single file `bikeshare.py`.
- Also have removed third party library dependency.
### Before executing the below command:
_**Please make sure that the following directory is maintained after file exraction.**_
```
bikeshare/
        bikeshare.py
        dataset.7z
        README.md
```
